  // VS CODE TASKS CONFIGURATION FOR ELECTRON FORGE PROJECT
  // PURPOSE: Defines automated build tasks and lint operations accessible within
  // the VS Code environment
  // SECURITY IMPACT FOR DEVELOPERS: Potentially Significant - Executes scripts when triggered
  // that can affect the development environment; introduces potential risks if tasks are
  // modified or additional high-privilege tasks are added over time
  // SECURITY IMPACT FOR APPLICATION END-USERS: Potentially Significant - Potentially could be used
  // for purposes that affect the end-user application
